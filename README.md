###### Coldplay

Coldplay is my favorite band because their music blends **meaningful** lyrics with emotional melodies that are easy to connect to. Their songs often focus on hope, love, and **resilience**, which makes them relatable in different stages of life. I also like how their sound has evolved over time—from softer, **acoustic styles** to more experimental and upbeat tracks—while still keeping their unique identity.

### Places I Want to Visit

I have always dreamed of traveling to different parts of the world. The following table lists four places I would like to visit, along with why I chose them, how far they are from my home, and my estimated budget for a week-long trip.  

| Place             | Reason to Visit                                      | Distance from Home | Budget (USD) |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Japan             | Explore the culture, food, and cherry blossoms     | 6,800 miles      | 2,500        |
| Italy             | See historical landmarks and enjoy Italian cuisine | 4,500 miles      | 2,000        |
| Australia         | Experience unique wildlife and beaches             | 10,000 miles     | 3,000        |

### Part 9: Code Fencing

This snippet demonstrates the use of **abstract base classes (ABC)** in Python.  
The `BaseClass` defines abstract methods `foo` and `bar` that must be implemented by any subclass.  
The `ConcreteClass` inherits from `BaseClass` and provides concrete implementations for these methods.  
Finally, an instance of `ConcreteClass` is created, showing how abstract methods are enforced.

```python
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod


class BaseClass(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def foo(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def bar(self):
        pass


class ConcreteClass(BaseClass):
    def foo(self):
        pass

    def bar(self):
        pass


instance = ConcreteClass()
