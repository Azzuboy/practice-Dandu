###### Coldplay

Coldplay is my favorite band because their music blends **meaningful** lyrics with emotional melodies that are easy to connect to. Their songs often focus on hope, love, and **resilience**, which makes them relatable in different stages of life. I also like how their sound has evolved over time—from softer, **acoustic styles** to more experimental and upbeat tracks—while still keeping their unique identity.
