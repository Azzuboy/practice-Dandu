### Favorite Location

My favorite place to visit is the Maldives. I like it because of its clear blue water, soft white sand, and peaceful beaches. It is a perfect place to relax and enjoy nature. I also like swimming and snorkeling there to see colorful fish and coral. Visiting the Maldives makes me feel calm and happy.
